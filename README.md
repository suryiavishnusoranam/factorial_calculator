# Overview

This software project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of Erlang's capabilities in functional programming. It includes implementations of fundamental algorithms and showcases Erlang's syntax features such as recursion, pattern matching, and list operations. Through practical examples and tests, this project aims to illustrate effective use of Erlang for solving common programming challenges.

My purpose to work on this project is to deepen my understanding of Erlang programming language and its functional programming paradigm. By implementing various algorithms and exploring Erlang's unique features, I aim to enhance my proficiency in using Erlang for practical software development.

# Development Environment

* VSCode: Used as the primary integrated development environment (IDE) for editing Erlang code. It provides syntax highlighting, integrated terminal, and Git integration.

* Erlang OTP: Used as the runtime environment for executing Erlang code. It includes the Erlang/OTP libraries and tools necessary for Erlang development.

* Erlang: A functional programming language known for its concurrency and fault-tolerance features. Erlang's syntax and features, such as pattern matching, recursion, and message passing, were extensively utilized in this project.
